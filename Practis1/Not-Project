What am I doing?

I am going to hit a Note project.
This page is just a way for me or the one you would like to know how this project is done:

+Form
+Put the inputs I need in it
+Link to JavaScript!
+input and form the forms in the js file by id
+Build Event for button
+Preventing the form of the form of form
+Making Function LI
+Get the user input value
+Making UL on the HTML page
+View LI on Output
